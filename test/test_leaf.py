"""Test leaf shape.

Build parameters for a leaf
1. Build a leaf shape (x, y, s, r)
2. Set the params
        leaf: a x,y,s,r tuple describing leaf shape
        L_shape: length of the shape
        Lw_shape: width of the shape
        length: the total visible length to be meshed
        s_base: normalised position (on the shape) of the start of the element
        s_top: normalised position (on the shape) of the end of the element
        flipx: should leaf shape be flipped ?
        twist:
        volume: float value of the thickness of the leaf.
              Default is 0. Else it indicates the relative depth of the leaf
              along the midrib.
        stem_diameter: the diameter of the sem at the leaf insertion point
        inclination: if relative=False, the leaf basal inclination (deg). A
        multiplier to leaf basal inclination angle otherwise
        relative: (bool) controls the meaning of inclination parameter

3. Understand how to build a growing leaf for 0 to 1;
