# Third chapter: Improving STICS


Modeling : How to model intercrops more accurately at crop scale, considering spatial issues when needed ?  

*Hypothesis: New crop models formalisms created through a multiscale approach would enable a better accuracy of the crop models.*  

Which formalisms would enable to translate spatial and structural considerations for chosen plant processes in a crop model ?  


For each plant process targeted previously:  
- Develop formalisms to implement in STICS, by any appropriate method.  
- Run simulations and compare with simulations with previous version and with field data, to make sure new version of STICS fits data even better. (see with Mathilde de Freitas ?)
